<!-- OUR STORY -->
<section class="content-section">
  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Calling All Zebras was created out of lived experience — not theory.
    It began with the realization that too many teens with chronic and
    invisible illnesses feel isolated, dismissed, or forced to grow up
    too fast in systems that weren’t built for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    This space exists to remind teens that their pain is real, their
    limits are valid, and their stories deserve to be heard.

    <!-- FOUNDER STORY -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Meet the Founder</h3>
      <p>
        Calling All Zebras was founded by a teen living with chronic illness
        who grew tired of being overlooked, misunderstood, and told they
        were “too young” to be sick.
      </p>

      <p>
        After navigating school, healthcare systems, and social spaces
        that often failed to make room for illness, the idea for this
        nonprofit emerged — a place built by teens, for teens.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project is rooted in empathy, accessibility, and the belief
        that community can be life-changing.

  <h2>What We Believe</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Teens Deserve to Be Believed</h3>
      <p>
        Chronic illness does not have an age requirement. Teens deserve
        validation, support, and autonomy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Community Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Healing doesn’t always mean getting better — sometimes it means
        not being alone.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Rest Is Not Failure</h3>
      <p>
        We reject productivity culture and honor fluctuating capacity.

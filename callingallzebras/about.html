<section class="content-section">
  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Calling All Zebras was created out of lived experience — not theory.
    It began with the realization that too many teens with chronic and
    invisible illnesses feel isolated, dismissed, or forced to grow up
    too fast in systems that weren’t built for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    This space exists to remind teens that their pain is real, their
    limits are valid, and their stories deserve to be heard.

      <h3>Meet the Founder</h3>
      <p>
        The idea for Calling All Zebras came from a place of deep hurt — and deep isolation.
      </p>

      <p>
       While other teens my age were worrying about upcoming tests or presentations, I was focused on surviving. During my sophomore year of high school, I spent more time in the hospital than I did in class. On the days I was able to attend school, they often ended in emergency calls and yet another hospital admission.
      </p>

      <p>
       As my health declined, so did my sense of certainty in myself. I went from specialist to specialist, collecting after-visit summaries that all seemed to say the same thing in different ways: <b><i>“Your case is too complex, and we don’t know how to help you.”</i></b>
      </p>

      <p>Over time, I began to internalize those words. I felt alone. I questioned my body. I truly believed I was the only teen living with a body that worked against them — that I was somehow broken beyond repair.</p>
      <p> Calling All Zebras exists to challenge that belief.</p>

      <p> This project was created to be a safe, supportive space for teens living with chronic and invisible illnesses — a place where young people don’t have to prove their pain or explain their reality. It is a resource for connection, understanding, and community for those of us who have felt like a missing or broken puzzle piece.</p>

      <p> <b>Here, no one has to navigate illness alone. </b> </p>

  <h2>This Story Is Bigger Than One Person</h2>

  <p>
    When I started looking for community, I realized how many teens were
    navigating chronic illness quietly and without support.
  </p>

  <p class="soft-stat">
    Studies estimate that over 30% of U.S. adolescents live with at least one
    chronic health condition.<sup>1</sup>
  </p>

  <p class="stat-note">
    That number represents real people — students, siblings, and friends —
    whose stories often go unheard.

  <h2>What We Believe</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Teens Deserve to Be Believed</h3>
      <p>
        Chronic illness does not have an age requirement. Teens deserve
        validation, support, and autonomy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Community Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Healing doesn’t always mean getting better — sometimes it means
        not being alone.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Rest Is Not Failure</h3>
      <p>
        We reject productivity culture and honor fluctuating capacity.
